# Progress bar not updating

Hello everyone,

I'm currently having some issues with getting my file copy progress bar to work in Trongate.

My first ajax check folder exists works fine just fine.

My second ajax copies my images to a provided folder just fine.

My third ajax to check percentage of copied files via interval fails to display 10%...20%... as the file are beign copied.

I have already successfully implemented this feature outside Trongate with the progress bar being displayed as files are copied to the folder, but in Trongate it seems to skip my third ajax call. I am suspecting that perhaps I have my php cal_progress function setup incorrectly preventing it from being called when copy file begins.

I would really appreciate any help or advice on how to resolve this issue.

Thank you in advance!
