# Progress bar not updating

Hello everyone,

I'm currently having some issues with getting my file save progress bar to work in Trongate.

My first ajax check folder exists works fine just fine.

My second ajax copies my images to a provided folder just fine.

My third ajax to check percentage of copied files using intervals fails to display 10%...20%... and so on.

I have already successfully implemented this feature outside Trongate with the progress bar being displayed but in Trongate it seems to skip my third ajax cal_progress. I am suspecting that perhaps I have my cal_progress function setup incorrectly preventing it being called when copy file begins.

I would really appreciate any help or advice on how to resolve this issue.

Thank you in advance!
